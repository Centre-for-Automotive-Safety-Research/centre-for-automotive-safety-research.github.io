# CASR's data blog

## About us
The Centre for Automotive Safety Research (CASR) is a multidisciplinary research centre at the University of Adelaide, dedicated to improving road safety through evidence-based research. Our goal is simple but vital: to help eliminate harm on our roads.

This blog has been created by CASR's data analysts. We’re the team crunching the numbers and statistics behind CASR’s research. This blog is where we share insights, cool projects, and the occasional “ah-ha” moment from working with road safety data. It's our way of opening the data-door to anyone who's curious. 

Our go-to programming language is **Python**. It's powerful, flexible, and great for sharing reproducible analysis. All our blog posts will feature Python code, so if you're a fellow coder or just curious, you'll be able to follow along, adapt our methods, and explore the data yourself.

## Road safety data analysis
Road safety data comes in many shapes and sizes — from crash reports to road infrastructure maps. In this blog, we’ll aim to use publicly available datasets wherever possible, so our analyses are open, transparent, and ready for you to experiment with.

### Crash data
Here in South Australia, we are fortunate that the South Australian government's Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT) uploads semi-detailed data to a publicly available platform: [Data.SA](https://data.sa.gov.au/).

We’ve created a blog post showing you how to download and start exploring this dataset. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned analyst, it’s a great place to start.

### Road characteristics
Understanding the roads themselves is just as important as analysing crash data. Fortunately, there are several publicly available datasets packed with useful information about road layouts, traffic flow, and infrastructure.

Two key sources we often use are:

- **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** A global, crowd-sourced mapping platform providing detailed road network data, including road types, speed limits, and points of interest.
- **Location SA:** South Australia’s official spatial data provider offers comprehensive maps and datasets covering road infrastructure, traffic volumes, and other transport-related information.

In this blog, we’ll show you how to access and use these datasets to enrich road safety analyses, helping to uncover how road characteristics influence crash patterns.

## Statistics
We're always learning, especially when it comes to statistical techniques. In future posts, we’ll cover different methods we use to analyse data, explain how they work, and discuss how they can be applied in real-world road safety research.
