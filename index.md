The Centre for Automotive Safety Research (CASR) is a multidisciplinary research centre at the University of Adelaide, dedicated to improving road safety through evidence-based research. Our goal is simple but vital: to help eliminate harm on our roads.

This blog has been created by CASR's data analysts. We’re the team crunching the numbers and statistics behind CASR’s research. This blog is where we share insights, cool projects, and the occasional “ah-ha” moment from working with road safety data. It's our way of opening the data-door to anyone who's curious.
